# Literature Review: Bolted vs. Welded Moment Connections

This repository contains the LaTeX source and compiled PDF for the literature review:

Moment-resisting connections are critical in steel structures for transferring shear and bending moments. This review compares bolted and welded moment connections in terms of performance, fabrication, cost, and behavior under seismic and fatigue loading. It highlights the advantages, limitations, and contexts where each connection type is more suitable.
